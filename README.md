# CRM-Webflow Integration Middleware

**Version:** 2.0.0

## 1. Project Overview

This middleware connects a Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM with a Webflow frontend. It facilitates highly efficient, real-time data synchronization via targeted webhooks and provides robust API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the CRM. The entire application is designed for serverless deployment on Vercel.

This middleware is the backend for the exclusive event booking platform at [european-speed-club.com](https://www.european-speed-club.com).

## 2. Core Features

* **Targeted Real-time Sync**: Triggers a precise sync for only the single item that was created, updated, or deleted in the CRM, ensuring minimal processing delay.
* **Asynchronous Background Processing**: Uses Vercel's `waitUntil()` function to acknowledge webhooks instantly while processing the synchronization in the background, preventing CRM timeouts.
* **Race Condition Prevention**: Implements a locking mechanism using Vercel KV to prevent duplicate items from being created in Webflow if multiple webhooks for the same new item arrive simultaneously.
* **Resilient API Client**: The Webflow API client includes automatic retries with exponential backoff to handle API rate limits.
* **Robust Payload Parsing**: The sales order endpoint is hardened to correctly parse various formats of incoming JSON.
* **Secure Endpoints**: Protects the webhook with JWT authentication and the frontend APIs with CORS policies.

## 3. System Architecture

The middleware is composed of three main parts:

* **API Endpoints (`/api`)**: A set of serverless functions that handle requests from the Webflow frontend and the CRM.
* **CRM Library (`/lib/crm.js`)**: A library that handles all communication with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, including authentication and data retrieval/submission.
* **Scripts (`/scripts`)**: A collection of scripts for tasks like running a targeted data synchronization or testing the CRM connection.

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1. `POST /api/crm-webhook`

This endpoint listens for targeted `POST` requests from the CRM to trigger a single-item synchronization from the CRM to Webflow.

* **Authentication**: Requires a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer Token. The token is verified using the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable.
* **Request Body**: The JWT payload is expected to contain the following properties:
    * `entityName` (string, required): The name of the entity that was changed in the CRM.
    * `recordId` (string, required): The ID of the record that was changed.
    * `changeType` (string, required): The type of change that occurred (e.g., "Update", "Create", "Delete").
* **Response**:
    * `202 Accepted`: If the webhook is received successfully, the synchronization is triggered in the background.
    * `401 Unauthorized`: If the JWT is invalid or missing.
    * `405 Method Not Allowed`: If the request method is not `POST`.
    * `400 Bad Request`: If the JWT payload is missing required fields.

### 4.2. `GET /api/event-product`

This endpoint retrieves event products from the CRM based on an `eventId`.

* **Query Parameters**:
    * `eventId` (string, required): The ID of the event to retrieve products for.
* **Response**:
    * `200 OK`: Returns a JSON array of event products.
    * `400 Bad Request`: If the `eventId` query parameter is missing.
    * `500 Internal Server Error`: If there is an error fetching the data from the CRM.

### 4.3. `POST /api/m8_SubmitSalesOrderV2`

This endpoint submits a sales order to the CRM.

* **Request Body**: The request body is expected to be a JSON object containing the sales order data.
* **Response**:
    * `200 OK`: Returns the response from the CRM.
    * `500 Internal Server Error`: If there is an error submitting the sales order to the CRM.

## 5. Scripts

### 5.1. `node lib/crm.js`

This script tests the connection to the CRM by authenticating, running a `WhoAmI` request, and fetching lists of active entities. It saves the output to a log file for inspection.

### 5.2. `node scripts/sync_single.js <event-id> [Create|Update|Delete]`

This script runs the synchronization process for a single, specified event ID. This is useful for debugging or manual intervention. The `changeType` defaults to `Update` if not provided.

## 6. Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the application to run:

* `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key used to sign and verify JWTs for the CRM webhook.
* `CRM_TENANT_ID`: The ID of the Azure Active Directory tenant for the CRM.
* `CRM_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of the application registered in Azure Active Directory.
* `CRM_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of the application registered in Azure Active Directory.
* `CRM_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the Dynamics 365 CRM API.
* `WEBFLOW_API_TOKEN`: The API token for the Webflow project.
* `WEBFLOW_COLLECTION_ID_EVENTS`: The ID of the "Events" collection in Webflow.
* `WEBFLOW_COLLECTION_ID_LOCATIONS`: The ID of the "Locations" collection in Webflow.
* `WEBFLOW_COLLECTION_ID_CATEGORIES`: The ID of the "Categories" collection in Webflow.
* `WEBFLOW_COLLECTION_ID_AIRPORTS`: The ID of the "Airports" collection in Webflow.
* `KV_URL`: The URL for the Vercel KV store.
* `KV_REST_API_URL`: The REST API URL for the Vercel KV store.
* `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`: The read-write token for the Vercel KV store.
* `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`: The read-only token for the Vercel KV store.

## 7. Setup and Deployment

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install the dependencies:** `npm install`
3.  **Set up Vercel KV**: In your Vercel dashboard, create a KV database and connect it to your project.
4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project and add the environment variables listed above.
5.  **Deploy to Vercel.** The serverless functions in the `/api` directory will be automatically deployed.
